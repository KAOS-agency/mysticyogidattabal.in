                To Sri Dattabal consciousness while living ordinary life is
                essential to tune in with the divine love and compassion of the
                universe. Religions to him were different pathways towards the
                ultimate reality. They were the different expressions of the
                divine. He maintained that the true spirit of the religion lay
                in liberality, love and not in rigidity. He practiced what he
                professed and stood as an example. Being a contemplative seer,
                he was concerned with miseries of the world. He took an activist
                role on behalf of people marginalised on the basis of caste,
                class and other diversities.
              </p>
              <p>
                Sri Dattabal was born on 3rd April 1941 at Kolhapur Maharashtra.
                He had his formal education in Physics and lived in Kolhapur.
                His mother Sushila Devi became his follower and His father was a
                renowned educationist, Vedic scholar and writer. He left his
                body on 3rd September 1982. He predicted his date of death ten
                years earlier.

                Sri Dattabal was clairvoyant by birth and grew as a very
                sensitive child being able to see the inner side of nature.
                'While looking within himself he used to feel a different space
                – dimension in his heart, which awakened in him a sense of non-
                materiality about the material world. He could speak intimately
                with the nature and so called inanimate objects. As a teenager,
                he felt a tremendous overwhelming force of love, which he could
                also transmit and heal. He always regarded himself as an
                instrument of divine through which love is transformed into
                different powers'.
              </p>
              <p>
                He explained his philosophy of divine love in English, Marathi
                and Hindi through discussions, discourses and his audience
                included villagers, common women and men living ordinary lives,
                professionals, academicians, politicians, etc. Sri Dattabal was
                tireless and keen learner and was open to different philosophies
                He travelled extensively within India and abroad addressing
                contemporary issues connecting them to deep spirituality and
                love through his lectures, writings and discussions.

                  It is an urge to manifest the true spiritual nature that gives

                  atoms will be required. That organ of light is the flame-eye.
                  The flame - eye or the power of sensing is latent in every
                  human being, which will eventually develop into a human
                  faculty during the course of evolution"

                  "This booklet introduces the three practices called Triangular
                  Leadership Practices –Stillness Practice, Body Training and
                  Speaking the Un-speakable. Stillness Practice is about
                  stilling the mind to create space for the intuitive and 'all
                  knowing' part of us to emerge and guide us through our path
                  and purpose in life. Speaking the unspeakable is a practice of
                  dialogue that lets us speak our true fears, thoughts, needs,
                  emotions, and true stories of one self. Body Training as a
                  practice helps us to become mindful about our bodies and its
                  unlimited wisdom.

                  their path in this world. The book is presented in three
                  sections of Moon Cycle1, 2 & 3. Moon cycle1 presents the
                  connection of woman's body to cosmos, Moon mother, Earth
                  Mother, and other women and teaches a set of practices called
                  triangular practices. The second moon cycle builds
                  perspectives on the web of energetic connections to cosmos,
                  earth and women. Third moon cycle deals with mystic processes
                  and energetic connections between cosmos, earth and women.

                  The spring of youth draws towards itself the surging throngs
                  of dreams and out of these you choose for yourself a dream
                  which is in consonance with your inner being. You then
                  struggle life long to make the dream a reality. During this
                  struggle you pass several stages. You have to march ahead
                  through the shadow of success and failure. Some of your dreams
                  do materialise but most of them remain just dreams. Those who
                  do not have any dreams at all and yet do not aspire to have
                  dreams are either stagnating in the dark cell of ignorance or
                  the goddess of youth has passed away from their life, without
                  taking their slightest notice.

                  on the vibratory plane, a thing seems some what different
                  owing to the magnetic waves – that is what shri. Dattabal
                  explained to us. Further he says "beyond the vibratory plane
                  there is the inspiratory plane. There are in all seven planes.
                  Amongst one of them (the last one), there is the plane on

              <h3>Is Democracy Being Outdated?</h3>
              <div class="content-scroll">
                <p>
                  In the process of evolution mankind achieves a certain level
                  of intelligence and ruling government reveals the mental
                  status of the people. while men of quick intelligence
                  sacrificed their life for establishing democracy. At this
                  stage, the very thought of democracy getting obsolescent
                  sounds to be fanciful. However, let us try to study the rise
                  of democracy in a new light.
                </p>
                <p>
                  when man took a leap forward from instinct to intelligence his
                  entire mental and social pattern was revolutionised. Now when
                  he will enter into the realm of intuition he must be prepared
                  for mutation. The form of the government which intuitive
                  people will choose may not be socialistic nor democratic. so
                  the democratic values ( we so much cherish today) will crumble
                  down.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Since intuition comes from the deepest core of existence in
                  man, which is in resonance with the cosmic mind, all parochial
                  governments will become outdated and the world government may
                  emerge. Here there will not be green revolutions nor economic
                  revolutions but there will be frequent revolutions of
                  consciousness.

                  The sacred red mountain of Arunachalam was bathing in the
                  mist. Rapt in deep Samadhi its peak was thrusting into the
                  azure sky. Shri Ramana Maharishi had unveiled life's secret at
                  this holy place. I was one of the pilgrims, set out to visit
                  the Maharishi's hermitage.

                <p>
                  In the medley of dark, brown and yellow there was a
                  white-complexioned American bhakta who looked very
                  conspicuous. He was a half naked hippie with a loin-cloth
                  barely covering his shame. He had become familiar with that
                  place. His eyes radiated love and compassion. Most of his time
                  was spent in meditation, prayer and worship of the Sun.

                  It is only people who are indolent and weak that are trapped
                  in silken cocoon of self-centeredness. They choose the warmth
                  of cocoon to the joy of freedom. By binding the life that is
                  winged, they cripple themselves. Life moves forward swiftly
                  and those who do not keep pace with its speed are dragged
                  along mercilessly. Allow nature to act upon you, to perform
                  the painful surgery on your ego. And by doing so, it is trying
                  to bring you to state of more conscious existence. It is
                  trying to return you to the divine kingdom, to which you
                  originally belong.

                  Death has amused poets, thrilled philosophers. Majestically
                  awed religionists and consoled those without hope. It has a
                  charm like Mona Lisa's smile. It has an aura of unknown. The
                  face of death is not necessarily hostile but the subconscious
                  has an ingrained fear of death. It is the fear of death that
                  gives men the biological intuition to save themselves.

                  Swami Vivekananda and Shri Shankaracharya. But the saffron
                  robed parakeets of Vedanta philosophy exhibited their petty

                  As divine love passes through different regions of our mind,
                  it is refracted. There is a refraction in the subconscious
                  mind which we called the libido, another refraction in the
                  conscious mind, which is known as the ego, and the final
                  refraction in the body layer which we call sex. Sex is not a
                  hostile force to be fought with, for sex is but a shadow and
                  its chase does not bring about any sublimation. Nature has
                  endowed this force for the dual purpose of procreation and
                  transformation.

              <h3>Symphonies of Love</h3>
              <div class="content-scroll">
                <p>
                  It is a fine morning. Everything is silent. The sun has risen
                  just now. Flowers are blooming, trees are silently radiating
                  their inner calm. There is mute music on the earth, it is an
                  eternal music. Trees, mountains, stones, animals are all
                  different notes of this music and man is an octave amongst
                  these notes. The divine is humming in the music, this is the
                  music of love. Everything here is trying to express this music
                  of love.

              <div class="content-scroll">
                <p>
                  Friends, you know that under the layers of ice in snow-clad
                  cities of europe, certain well formed designs are seen. Few of
                  you might even be knowing the design patterns of the Tantric
                  system like Shri Chakra. Now please understand that the
                  evolutionary urge in matter also, while expressing itself
                  takes takes up a form.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Today we shall try to travel towards, the light of the inner
                  flame. The flame which is in the centre of our conscious-ness,
                  the very nucleus of our existence. This flame has a centre
                  everywhere and circumference nowhere. this the realm which is
                  beyond the threshold of the subconscious mind and
                  psychologists have failed to explore it. When you penetrate
                  deep within yourself, you are bound to come across the hell of
                  subconscious mind. But you must pass through it, as every
                  mystic has to travel through it: then only you come upon that
                  centre which is everywhere and then only you see this flame,
                  the pulsating centre of consciousness and the moment you come
                  to this centre you become absolutely fearless.

                  I think the basic cause of evolution from a lower form to the
                  higher, is the urge of self-expression, endowed in each and
                  every micro-organism. Hegal was perfectly correct when he said
                  that life evolves through a process of thesis, anti-thesis and
                  synthesis. Even a uni-cellular micro organism proposes to seek
                  some thing, it tries to unfold its inner nature just like a
                  tiny seed that tries to unfold itself to finally become a
                  grown up tree with huge branches, hundreds of leaves and
                  fruits. This is the thesis of the cell.

              <h3>Sex to Divine Love</h3>
              <div class="content-scroll">
                <p>
                  So, Divine love is universal. It is the realisation of the
                  universal force, and when one is aware of the innermost flame,
                  the capacity of transformation is spontaneously achieved. So,
                  when a cosmic ray touches the earth's hemisphere it produces
                  an evolutionary change, a cosmic chemical change, bringing
                  about mutation. The cosmic ray has definite frequency. It
                  affects the earth molecule, accelerates their frequency and
                  brings about an evolved emergent form. The ray of divine love
                  has the highest rate of vibrations. It can, therefore,
                  penetrate through anything in this universe. This vibratory
                  rate can be infused into the organic and inorganic molecules
                  of the earth to bring about the transformation. So, when you
                  become aware of the divine love everything around you changes
                  structurally and organically.
